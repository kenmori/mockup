Go lang and CSP is really cool, right? Async work looks like sync work and all the code is together making it easy to rationalize about. But I can’t use that in my web app. That’s where ClojureScript comes in. Their community is known for just using great ideas from other programming languages. ClojureScript’s core.async is fabulous. They basically stole the best parts of Go and FRP is an API that’s super simple. Core.async feels like programming 5 years in the future. Core async has Go channel, that “park” to make async code look like sync code and on top of that they’ve added transducers. Transducers are these awesome things to take a bunch of abstract functions that do minor task and quickly compose them together and attach them to a channel.
