RxJS is great. So why have I moved on?
Almost a year ago I started using React for “greenfield” internal projects at work. One of the huge benefits of the web is having everyone wants their programming language patterns and ideas into JavaScript. So having libraries that can switched out and in without rewriting the entire code base is huge plus. React was great for views but for handling data and rest calls I was looking for something else. I tried a couple Flux implementations but quickly attached onto FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) libraries like RxJS and Bacon. I spent 4 months using and learning FRP for my daily coding. It’s still powering an internal web app we use everyday.
