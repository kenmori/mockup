RxJS and FRP in its prime
RxJS does a lot of things really great. It allows you to create custom event streams that can have multiple listeners on the output. The observables model and chaining transforms are very useful and help keep related pieces of code together. Observables create stream that can be combined with other streams. It takes away the global events and keeps them localized to where your code needs the to react to the events. If youâ€™ve used Mutation Observers or data binding or Backbone events in JS or KVO or NSNotificationCenter in Objective-C, RxJS like that but much more powerful. RxJS elevates data flow to be a first class architectural pattern on the level of MVC.
