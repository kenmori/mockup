FRP tries to solve the problem of asynchronous work, event propagation and data transforms that happen as a result of events about your code base. Basically you create an observable that reacts when an event is triggered. The trigger could be a UI event, like on click, or a network request or other things. Each trigger returns a stream that you can chain (ala jQuery) to change or combine other streams together. ReactiveX group does a much better job explaining what they do. Their site is really great at explaining FRP http://reactivex.io/.
