Merging and combining streams is where it got muddy really fast. I had events going that were hard to track down. I lost the finer grain control when more than one stream was being used. I’m fully aware this could be my misunderstanding about how to use FRP. At the same time, the methods a library exposes guide developers about to best use them. Take for instance Backbone’s vs. Angular’s API. Backbone is every open and easy to do things outside the “intended” use; when in Angular doing things outside the intended patterns are much more difficult. API design guide developers into certain patterns.
